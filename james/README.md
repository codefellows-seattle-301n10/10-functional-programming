for some reason I can't get server.js to link to index.html.  I tried moving it around in the filepath and adding type="application/javascript" to the script tag, which removes the MIME type error, but it still won't define any of its functions.  I tried moving it around to different parts of index.html but it didn't work.

I'm kind of stuck here because if I can't populate the database with the data from hackeripsum.json, none of the other scripts have any data to draw from.

I was closer than I thought, but got stuck on a fundamental misunderstanding of how the different parts were trying to talk to each other and what they are doing.  running both the front and back end from my local machine make these distinctions unclear sometimes.

Got through the first section of readme tasks, pushing changes for now.

Tasks complete, going to take a break and then clean up/review the code.  I understand all of the concepts when I see them presented, it's just really hard starting at square one and figuring out what concept to implement, but it's coming along.
