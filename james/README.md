for some reason I can't get server.js to link to index.html.  I tried moving it around in the filepath and adding type="application/javascript" to the script tag, which removes the MIME type error, but it still won't define any of its functions.  I tried moving it around to different parts of index.html but it didn't work.

I'm kind of stuck here because if I can't populate the database with the data from hackeripsum.json, none of the other scripts have any data to draw from.
